Global Explorer Prompt History


I want to build a 'Global Explorer Dashboard' application using python. It should include a clean, centered layout with a 'Search' button, and a display card.

Make it look modern with a semi-transparent background for the card so it can sit over an image later.

Write a Python function get_weather(city, api_key) that uses the requests library to call the OpenWeatherMap API. The function should return a weather description of the city.

Write another function get_image(city, api_key) that uses the requests library to call the Unsplash API. The function should return an image of the city.

Check for me if the APIs are functioning by matching the API keys with the API documentation.

Instead of leaving the right dashboard empty, integrate a new feature for displaying local tourism sites using the Wikipedia API.

Add a random location generator where the location will be generated through a fix list.

Change the title to Where do you want to travel today.

Implement the Random button again. 

The location tourism sites functions does not seems to work.

Write test_wiki.py to test the wikipedia API. 

Ask wikipedia to return some tourism sites instead of some info that we do not need to tell if I want to go there or not.

The search bar should be a bit larger.

The style of the tourism sites should be at better font.

In readme file, add what are the two API we used but do not include the API key itself.
