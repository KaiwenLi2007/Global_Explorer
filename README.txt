Global Explorer Project
=======================

This repository contains a small Streamlit-based dashboard demo called the "Global Explorer Dashboard".

Run locally
---------

1. Create and activate a Python environment (recommended).
2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the dashboard:

```powershell
streamlit run app.py

The app provides a centered layout with a search input, a `Search` button, and a result display card (placeholder content).
